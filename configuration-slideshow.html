# Configure Vegetables

---
## Where?
Vegetables is able to start without any configuration.

However you surely want to customize parameters, such as the Web site title.

So, the first thing to do is adding a new file in the Markdown documents folder, named `vegetables.json` or `vegetables.yml`.

Yes, Vegetables supports both JSON and YAML.

An example with JSON:

```json
{
    "template": "my-customize-template-folder",
    "tags": {
        "globalTitle": "My Web site",
        "menu": [
            {
                "uri": "index.html",
                "label": "Homepage"
            },
            {
                "uri": "another-page.html",
                "label": "Another page"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The same, with YAML:

```yaml
template: my-customize-template-folder
tags:
 globalTitle: My Web site
 menu:
  - uri: index.html
    label: Homepage
  - uri: another-page.html
    label: Another page
```

---
class: center, middle, title

## Global parameters

---
### Template
By default, the template included with Vegetables is used, or if you have a `template` folder in your Markdown documents folder, it is automatically taken into account.

Otherwise, the `template` parameter is made for you:

```json
{
    "template": "path/of/the/template"
}
```

---
### Host and port
This is preview mode host and port, i.e. the ones to access the preview version of your Web site after typing `vegetables serve`.

If you want to give access to the preview version of your Web site, set the host to `*`.  
Otherwise, no one, except you, will be able to connect to it.

```json
{
    "host": "*",
    "port": 8123
}
```
The default port is `8888`, so you can view your Web site at `http://localhost:8888`.


---
### Additional media
During the generation, the structure of your documentation folder is copied, to create the HTML version of the Markdown documents.

Moreover, media files are copied: `jpg` (and `jpeg`), `png`, `gif`, `svg` and `html`.

You can add file formats to this list with `additionalMedia`:

```json
{
    "additionalMedia": ["pdf", "avi"]
}
```
Here, all the formats listed above, plus `pdf` and `avi` files are copied.

It is also possible to replace the default format list with the `media` parameter:

```json
{
    "media": ["htm", "html", "pdf"]
}
```
Here, only `html` and `pdf` files are copied.


---
### Before and after scripts
It is possible to start action before and after Web pages are generated.

For example, to start a command before:

```json
{
    "before": "cp .htaccess .vegetables/websites"
}
```
Commands are **always started from the documents folder**.

It is also possible to start many commands, including it in an array:

```json
{
    "before": [
        "cp .htaccess .vegetables/websites",
        "cp robots.txt .vegetables/websites"
    ],
    "after": "echo Finished!"
}
```

---
### Auto open
Right after starting Vegetables with the `serve` option, the homepage is automatically started in your favorite browser.

If you want to disable this feature, simply set `serveAutoOpen` to false in the configuration file.


---
### Auto reload
When you are writing Markdown with the serve mode enabled (i.e. you started Vegetables with `vegetables serve`), the content in your browser is automatically refreshed when changes happen.

You can disable this feature, setting `serveAutoReload` to false in the configuration file.


---
## Tags parameters
Tags parameters are parameters passed directly to the template, in order to display it using the Mustache syntax.

Knowing that, if you [make your own templates](templates.html), this is a direct gate to transmit global data.

For example, a common tag is `globalTitle`, i.e. the generated Web site title, to display near the page title.

Tags value are not only strings: another tag, shown in the example above, is the `menu` tag, which is a list of objects, containing the data for each page in the menu.  
The default template only needs the `uri` and the `label`, but it may accept, according to your template, an icon name or a sub title to display under/near the label.


---
### Global title
This is the Web site title, it can be, for example, added near the page title in the `&lt;title&gt;` HTML tag.


---
### Menu
This is the menu, as a list of objects:

```json
{
    "tags": {
        "menu": [
            {
                "uri": "index.html",
                "label": "Homepage"
            },
            {
                "uri": "another-page.html",
                "label": "Another page"
            },
            {
                "uri": "https://github.io",
                "label": "GitHub"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
The `uri` may be absolute, to link another Web site, or relative, to link an internal page.


---
## Page options tags
It is possible to define tags per page, directly in the configuration file.

For example:

```json
{
    "pageOptions": {
        "README.md": {
            "title": "Homepage"
        }
    }
}
```
This means that the title of pages generated from `README.md` will be replaced with `Homepage`.

Take a look at the [documents writing documentation page](write-documents.html) for further details about the title page.


---
### Wildcards
In the configuration file, the `pageOptions` document names can contain wildcards, i.e. `*` and `?`.

An example, with YAML:

```yaml
pageOptions:
 - README.md:
  title: Welcome to my site
 - documentation/README.md
  title: This is the documentaion homepage
 - documentation/*
  title: A documentation page
```
Here, the homepage title is `Welcome to my site`, the documentation homepage is `This is the documentaion homepage` and other pages in the `documentation` folder have the same title: `A documentation page`.

When a document matches with many wildcards, properties are merged, with this rules:


- properties of fully qualified document names have the greater priority, they are always kept
- the last defined properties has the greater priority.

For example:

```yaml
pageOptions:
 - documentation/intro-config-part1.md
   title: First part of configuration
 - documentation/*
   title: A documentation page
   menu:
    - uri: index.html
      label: Homepage
    - uri: documentation/index.html
      label: Documentation
    - uri: documentation/intro-config-part1.html
      label: Introduction
 - documentation/intro*
  title: Introduction
```
Here, `documentation/intro-config-part1.html` has its own title, every pages in `documentation` starting with `intro` have another title and other pages in `documentation` have a third title.

Moreover, every pages in `documentation` have a customized menu.


---
### Layouts
If the template you use provides many layouts, i.e. different page templates, you can define it using the `layout` parameter, in the page options tags (or directly [in the Markdown document](write-documents.html)).

For example, with YAML:

```yaml
pageOptions:
 - README.md:
  title: Welcome to my site
  layout: homepage
```

---
## CLI parameters
Some parameters can be provided directly in the command line, when starting Vegetables, for example:

```
vegetables serve --port 8123 --host *
```
Or:

```
vegetables generate --template="~/my-template"
```
Or:

```
vegetables deploy --globaltitle="My GitHub pages"
```
To know which parameters are available, use the CLI help command:

```

```
